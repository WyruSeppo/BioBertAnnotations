# BioBertAnnotations

prerequisites:
We used Visual Studio Code and Python 3.11.9

When you clone this repository, ou can set up the environment by running python -m venv .venv,
activating the environment,
and using pip install -r requirements.txt.
This will istall pytorch and transformers, which we need for this project.
But those libraries are too big to include in this repo
